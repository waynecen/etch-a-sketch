# Etch-a-sketch

A fun exploration based on the children's toy: Etch A Sketch.

[Link to Web Browser Version of Etch-A-Sketch](https://waynecen.github.io/project/etch-a-sketch/)

Takes the user's input for size of grid dimensions and colours the grid by hovering over the squares.

## Motivation
This project was created to learn fundamentals of Javascript and improve problem solving skills.

## What I Learned
- Manipulated elements through JavaScript, learned how to append parent/child elements together
- Improved understanding of nested loops, and how to create functions to improve efficiency with creating squares for the grid
- Learned how to use Sass, extension to CSS, mostly exploring variable usage

## Future Features
Features to be implemented (possibly) if project were revisited
- [ ] Responsive
- [ ] Input field for grid dimensions
- [ ] Different colours
